==== Possible Issues ====

** “Are you sure you want to do this?” **
If you get the “Are you sure you want to do this” message when installing AegaeusWP.zip file via WordPress, it means you have an upload file size limit. Install the theme via FTP if this happens, or ask your hosting company to increase the limit.

** Missing stylesheet file **
If you get an error saying that the stylesheet is missing, then you have uploaded the wrong folder. Please check that you are uploading the AegaeusWP.zip within the theme files folder.
